Hotel Management System in Python
=================================

A basic Hotel Management System developed in Python. The program at the end of development is expected to perform the following functions precisely:

- Check Room Availability
- Book Rooms
- Order Food
- Get data by customer name/id
- View staff data and perform related activities like playing salary, allowing leaves, etc
- Send Mails
- Room Status Check by number (clean/not clean and other related details)


Development might be slow and even stationary at times, depends on my school.
